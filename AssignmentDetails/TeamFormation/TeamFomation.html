        <h2>Team Formation</h2>
        <h3>Details:</h3>
        <p>
        &emsp;Reach out on Discord to begin forming groups. Team formation is self selection. You can use the #general chat to assist. 12 group categories also exist. My only requirement is that a group should avoid having two people who rated
            <br>&emsp;themselves inGroup Imposter and also two who ratedthemselves in Group Eager. Past experience has demonstrated:
        <br>&emsp;• Teams with two Group Imposters end up putting all the burden on the other group member
        <br>&emsp;• Teams full of Group Imposters feel comfortable and happy with each other, but get nothing done
        <br>&emsp;• Teams with two Group Eagers do most of the work and the other individual feels left out and doesn't learn much
        <br>&emsp;• Teams full of Group Eager don't get to learn valuable team managerial skills
        <br>&emsp;• The group you form here will likely be kept throughout the rest of the semester. Though we can change as need permits. Just ask me if that's the case.(I've seen some absolutely bizarre group dynamic situations in the past. Please
            <br>&emsp;don't hesitate to ask.)
