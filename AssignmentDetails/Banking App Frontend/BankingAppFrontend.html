        <h2>Banking App - Frontend</h2>
        <h3>Details:</h3>
        <p>
        <b>&ensp;Goal:</b>
        <br>&emsp;Previously you implemented a basic banking app. We want to expand this banking app into something larger.
        <br><b>&ensp;Approach:</b>
        <br>&emsp;• The instructions here are somewhat higher level to correlate with a course's theme of increased independence.
        <br>&emsp;• Many software engineers, myself included, believe that designing the front-end first is the optimal approach. This assignment will do the same. The approach will be to design a *clean* front end, and then implement the backend
            <br>&emsp;pieces in a second assignment.
        <br>&emsp;• A basic backend for filler / testing data is still a good idea.
        <br><b>&ensp;Assignment:</b>
        <br>&emsp;Make a React front end for a banking app with the following features:
        <br>&emsp;• A functioning login system which requests a username, password, and verification of credentials.
        <br>&emsp;• Allow for three company roles: administrator, employee, customer
        <br>&emsp;Administrators:
        <br>&emsp;• Can access all screens.
        <br>&emsp;• Administrators can even have their own bank accounts. (This makes things simpler.)
        <br>&emsp;• Can elevate/demote rights. Any customer, employee, or administrator can be reassigned into a different role
        <br>&emsp;Customers:
        <br>&emsp;• All users should be assigned a bank customer ID number. This number should be simple to remember and later on cannot be a data store key.
        <br>&emsp;• Allow the user deposit/withdraw money into three accounts labeled savings, checking, and investment. 
        <br>&emsp;• Allow the user to transfer money into any of the three accounts.
        <br>&emsp;• Show both a full account transaction history and an individual account transaction history, with date times and money changes. 
        <br>&emsp;Employees:
        <br>&emsp;• Can view any account associated with a bank customer ID, and likewise deposit/withdraw/transfer money.
        <br>&emsp;• Allow the user to transfer money to another customer's account. This requires knowledge of the other customer's ID
        <br>&emsp;Clean UI:
        <br>&emsp;• The site needs to have a consistent theme and CSS. Many options exist here. I personally find bootstrap easy and straightforward.
        <br>&emsp;• The site should appear reasonably polished. Items aligned and justified, enough room per textbox, style shouldn't appear like plain HTML, etc.
