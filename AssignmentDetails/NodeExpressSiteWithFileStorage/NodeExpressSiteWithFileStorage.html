        <br>&emsp;Practice Node and Express in preparation for upcoming React assignments.
        <br><b>&ensp;Assignment Overview:</b>
        <br>&emsp;Create a Node/Express website which has the following characteristics:
        <br>&emsp;• One HTML page which uses an HTML form to ask the user for a first name, last name, and favorite food. This HTML page exists on the
            <br>&emsp;&ensp;backend. It has a form in it.  The form itself upon submission sends data to a route on your backend. The route then stores all three pieces of information into a text file.
        <br>&emsp;• Another page which displays all information found in that file in that text file. This page does NOT exist as an HTML page on the backend. Rather it's a route which generates one big HTML string. Or in other words, when the user
            <br>&emsp;&ensp;invokes the route, the route then starts generating an HTML page via a string. The route then reads the file. For each entry in the file, add one more table row into the string. When the file is done, complete the HTML string. When
            <br>&emsp;&ensp;the string is fully generated, the route sends that HTML string back to the user as part of a res.send() call. (Note, this is ugly design! React will make this much cleaner.)
        <br>&emsp;• Another HTML page which asks the user for a food. It then displays all people who match that food. This HTML page does exist on the
            <br>&emsp;&ensp;backend. It has a form in it. The form itself upon submission sends data to a route on the backend. The route on the backend then sends a big HTML string back to the user to display this as part of a res.send() call.
        <br>&emsp;• Has a clean layout with routes and pages organized into separate folders.</p>
