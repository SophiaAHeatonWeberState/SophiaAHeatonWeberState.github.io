        <h2>Hangman Game</h2>
        <h3>Details:</h3>
        <p>
        <b>&ensp;Goal:</b>
        <br>&emsp;Work as a group to write your first group project.
        <br><b>&ensp;Overall Assignment:</b>
        <br>&emsp;Write a Hangman game with two parts: 1: game logic, and 2: high scores
        <br><b>&ensp;Game logic:</b>
        <br>&emsp;A session must be used to store the user's name at the end of a successful game. Do not ask for the username at the end of the game.
        <br>&emsp;Words must be randomly chosen from a list of words. Store all potential words in an existing database table or a file of numerous dictionary words.  The word itself should never be sent to the client except at the end of the game (we
            <br>&emsp;don't want a smart user inspecting DOM and finding the solution early.) The scores table should store the person's name, number of guesses, and number of letters in the word.
        <br><b>&ensp;High scores:</b>
        <br>&emsp;Show the top 10 scores for the amount of letters in this word.  For example, if the word had 8 letters, then show the 8 letter high scores table.  Show how many guesses (either total or missed guesses), and report the best top 10 results.
